facts:
  - text: Surges in deforestation and the killing of wolves, cougars and jaguars have effectively cleared the way for Coyotes to roam farther and wider than they ever have before, with researchers believing they're on track to enter South America within the next decade.

  - text: Unlike the wolf, which has been known to practice both monogamous and bigamous matings, the coyote is strictly monogamous, even in areas with high coyote densities and abundant food.
  - text: The oldest known fossils that would resemble the modern coyote were found inside of Hamilton Cave, West Virginia and would be somewhere between 740-850 thousand years old.
  - text: The coyote breeding season runs from January to March each year. In the spring, female coyotes build dens in preparation for their young. Females have a gestation period of about 63 days and give birth to groups of six pups on average. The groups of pups are called litters.
  - text: Coyotes generally amble about at a normal dog's walking speed. However, they can reach speeds of 35 to 43 mph when pursuing prey or fleeing danger.
  - text: Coyotes live across North America and roam the plains, forests, mountains and deserts of North America. They have colonized all of the continent except for the polar regions, and continue to move south.
  - text: Coyotes are not picky eaters. They hunt and eat small prey, such as rodents, rabbits and squirrels, as well as insects and fruit, depending on what is available to them.
  - text: Pups reach adulthood and sexual maturity within a year of being born. Coyotes typically live for around 5 to 6 years in the wild, and have been known to reach a maximum lifespan of up to 12 years.
  - text: Coyotes are primarily carnivorous, but will also eat fruits and berries on occasion. They hunt at night for mammals, birds, mice, and snakes. Most of the time they hunt alone, but when they hunt for large prey such as deer, they will hunt in packs.
  - text: By far, the most common cause of death for urban coyotes has been collisions with vehicles (40 to 70% of deaths each year). Given the large areas traversed by coyotes and the number of roads regularly crossed during their activities, this is not surprising.
